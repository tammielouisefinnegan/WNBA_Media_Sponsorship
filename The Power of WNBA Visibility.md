# The Power of Visibility - Quantifying the Media's Impact on the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA)

This project is in fulfillment of The Erdős Institute's Data Science Bootcamp Summer 2025.

Pitch:
Despite growing enthusiasm for women's sports, significant gaps remain in media coverage and investment. But how much does visibility actually shape financial sustainability and audience engagement? This project leverages data science to analyze broadcast hours, and sponsorship patterns across the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). By identifying correlations between coverage and long-term growth, we can provide actionable insights that inform marketing strategies, league policies, and investment decisions. The goal? To turn visibility into tangible success and help drive systemic change in how women’s sports are valued.



Data:
The WNBA and its sponsors do not release detailed, granulated data on sponsorship agreements or broadcast contracts. Therefore, I have built this dataset utilizing the following third-party sources:
•	Broadcast Data: Using Across the Timeline, I first constructed a dataset that included all broadcasted WNBA games from 2019-2024. This includes Home Team, Away Team, Game Type, Broadcast Network and Broadcast Channel.
•	Sponsorship Data: Using SponsorUnited’s annual Women in Sports Marketing Partnerships report, I constructed a dataset that included the annual average value (AAV) of the WNBA’s Media and Sponsorship Revenue from 2019-2014. As previously mentioned, the WNBA does not release granulated data on sponsorship agreements or broadcast contracts, so the reported figures are estimates. I also gathered the total number of Sponsors the WNBA had from 2019-2024.
